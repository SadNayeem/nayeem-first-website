    Features
  </h2>
  <p>
    The temple is large square edifice with five decorated ratnas or spires. The feature in the lower portion of the spires consists of ridges while the upper part is tapered upward.[1][5] It is built in brick masonry over a raised platform. The temple's interior has a square sanctum sanctorum (garbagriha), with four square chambers in the corners, narrow passages on all four sides and has cusped arched openings. The roof of the sanctum and the chambers is formed by semi-circular domes, while the roof over the passages is vaulted.[5] It has simple surface plastering but with fine detailing with red coloured terracotta patterns on all four outer walls.[2][5] It is said that the temple architecture was inspired by the Kantanaga Temple built about 100 years earlier. The terracotta designs are made in panels which have depiction of romantic scenes from the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Radha-Krishna episodes related to Krishna and Radha. The sanctum in the temple has a Krishna image which is worshipped by local Hindus.[2][5]
