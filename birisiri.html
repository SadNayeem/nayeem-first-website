    <p>It was time to go all out rural! No cars, no traffic, no smoke or smog, no laptops and no phones. That was the plan for Birishiri, a small town located in the Northern region of Netrokona in Bangladesh. The buzz and attraction about this place is mainly because of the crystal blue water in one of the lakes there, which is caused by erosion of the ceramic hills surrounding the lake.</p>

     <p>  Our trip to Birishiri was exactly as all trips should be – impromptu and planned within a day. With the decision taken on Wednesday, we started out for Birishiri on a Thursday at 7pm from Dhaka. After the initial traffic around the Tongi area, we were lucky to get to a free highway road (with a few stops for tea and samosas) and with Google Maps and plenty of stops for directions along the way, we reached Birishiri around 11pm at night. If you ever want to visit Birishiri in Bangladesh, do NOT venture there without a car. If you don’t have a car, go with a friend who has one or else rent a car (with a driver). Honestly, regardless of whether you are Bangladeshi or not, do this for your own safety and comfort. The last thing you need is being lost 200 kilometres away from Dhaka, trying to find your way back.

       <h2>located</h2>
       <p>Located around 200 km north of the city of Dhaka, close to the border between Bangladesh and India, Birishiri in the Netrokona District is gaining favor with travelers who appreciate natural beauty and enjoy visiting places off the beaten track. With the spectacular Durgapur ceramic hills as a backdrop, the Shomeshwari River is the centerpiece of the area’s scenic surroundings. The color of the river’s water changes as the level rises and falls through the seasons and it is always a delight to see. In the drier months, the river can be crossed on foot, while in the rainy season it swells in size, but is still relatively slow-flowing and boats are available as transportation to cross the river.</p>
       <h2>Beauty</h2> 
       <p>In addition to the natural beauty of Birishiri, visitors will find the rich cultural diversity fascinating. Ethnic groups found in the Netrokona District, of which Birishiri is a part, include the Banai tribe who speak their own dialect called Banai, and are followers of the Hindu religion. Also in the area are members of the Buna tribe who speak Bangla and practice Hinduism; the Garo tribe who speak Achik or Garo and follow the Christian religion; and the Hajong tribe who speak Hajong and practice Hinduism. There is an ethnic museum at Birishiri which offers insight into the history, traditions, languages and culture of the various tribes in the area.

        Visitors to Birishiri can travel by bus from Dhaka, taking note that the last 30 km of the journey is likely to be a bumpy ride as the road is rough. In the town rickshaw drivers are available to take visitors to all the best spots to visit and most travelers make use of this option, as the majority of rickshaw pullers are knowledgeable about the area, and it provides income for the locals.
        
        Places to visit include the palace of the Susang king, the Dasha Busha temple, Ramakrishna temple near Kula Para and Loknath Baba temple. The Orange forest and Spice Garden with its cinnamon and bay leaf trees provide a feast for the senses and a walk along the sandy banks of the Shomeshwari River is sure to be a relaxing, yet rejuvenating, experience.</p>
