     <h2>Hazrat Shahjalal Mazar</h2>
    <p>One of the holiest places in Sylhet.
        People travel from all over the country to Shahjalal and Shahporan Mazar.
        I personally do nor support a Mazar culture.
        However, Shahjalal offers the biggest prayer gathering in Sylhet.
        Still worth a visit.
        Please be aware as there are pickpocketers about.
        And DO NOT buy any candles or 'Agar Batti' as they are resold over and over again. Only certain individuals benefit.</p>
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>Hazrat Shah Jalal (Arabic: شيخ المشايخ‎, Bengali: শাহ জালাল, Shāh Jalāl ad-Dīn al-Mujarrad al-Turk al Naqshbandi; 1271 CE – 15 March 1346 CE) is a celebrated Sufi Muslim figure in Bengal. Jalal’s name is associated with the Muslim movement into north-eastern Bengal and the spread of Islam in Bangladesh through Sufism, part of a long history of travel between the Middle East, Persia, Central Asia and South Asia. According to a tablet inscription found in Amber Khana, he arrived at Sylhet in 1303. The largest airport in Bangladesh, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, is named after him.

            Hazrat Shah Jalal Yameny (RA) also known as Hazrat Shah Jalal Muzarrad (RA) arrived at Kamrup, the place within the terrain of Sreehatta, currently known as Sylhet in the Hijri year 703 equivalent to 1303 AD. 360 Sufi-Darbesh came to Sylhet to help him in preaching Islam. When Hazrat Shah Jalal (Ra) came to preach Islam overwhelming majority of people were Hindus. After his death, he is buried at Dargah Mahallah, Sylhet. It is now the Tomb of Hazrat Shah Jalal.
            
            According to legend, one day his uncle, Sheikh Kabir gave Shah Jalal a handful of soil and asked him to travel to India. He instructed him to choose to settle and propagate Islam in any place in India where the soil exactly matches that which he gave him in smell and color. Shah Jalal journeyed eastward and reached India in c. 1300, where he met many great scholars and Sufi mystics.
