     <h2>Durga Dagor</h2>
    <p>Durga Sagar, known locally as Madhabpasha Dighi,[1] is the largest lake in southern Bangladesh. It has a total area of about 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres). The lake is about 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) away from Barisal city. Rani Durgabati, mother of Raja Joy Narayan, had the pond excavated in 1780. There is a small island in the middle of the lake; this island was originally not part of the lake - it was created artificially to beautify and increase tourist attraction.</p>
